This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles potential index errors.  The error results from attempting to access an element that does not exist within the array, which can cause unpredictable results or program termination.
